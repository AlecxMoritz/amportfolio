            My name is Alecx Moritz. I graduated in 2012 from Westfield High School as a twelve-year senior, where my major areas of study were art, music, and history. I was also an active member of Key Club from my Sophomore year and onward, and active in various musical ensembles my highschool offered all throughout high school. Outside of school I enjoyed competing in Rubik's cube competitions, spending time with friends and family, and spending lots of time on the internet. My fascination with coding began when I was about twelve, and I started to build maps for a game I enjoyed playing. Years passed and the obsession settled into a hobby. After highschool I went into the workforce as a delivery driver for Domino's Pizza, and briefly was a student at Ivy Tech. I eventually left Domino's and I then began working as a cook on the St. Vincent West hospital campus. In the fall of 2014 I settled into another delivery driver job at a Jimmy John's, and six months later I became an assistant manager, and later a general manager. I learned quite a bit during my time there, and I am proud of my accomplisments; however, while I enjoyed this position, it was not my passion, and I was left trying to pursue technology and coding as a hobby.<img src="../assets/iWiT.png" id="iwitLogo" alt="IndyWomenInTech"></p>
            
            <p>Then I found the Eleven Fifty Academy. Immediately I knew this was the school and program for me. It would take some time to get everything set up to swtich careers, but it was the goal. I attended an Intro couse one weekend in mid February, and put in my two-weeks notice immediately after so I could start the three month course in March, where I was awarded the Indy Women In Tech Scholarship. The last three months have been a wild ride. I've gone from fumbling with HTML and CSS to creating fullstack applications using NodeJS and Angular and React, and am planning on learning so, so much more. </p>
