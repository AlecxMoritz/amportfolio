            <p>My name is Alecx Moritz. I graduated in 2012 from Westfield High School as a twelve-year senior, where my major areas of study were art, music, and history. I was also an active member of Key Club from my Sophomore year and onward, and active in various musical ensembled my highschool offered all throughout high school. Outside of school I enjoyed competing in Rubik's cube competitions, spending time with friends and family, and spending lots of time on the internet. My fascination with coding began when I was about twelve, and I started to build maps for a game I enjoyed playing. Years passed and the obsession settled into a hobby. After highschool I went into the workforce as a delivery driver for Domino's Pizza, and briefly was a student at Ivy Tech. I eventually left Domino's and I then began working as a cook on the St. Vincent West hospital campus.In the fall of 2014 I settled into another delivery driver job at a Jimmy John's, and six months later I became an assistant manager, and later a general manager. I learned quite a bit during my time with there, and I am proud of my accomplisments; however, while I enjoyed this position, it was not my passion, and I was left trying to pursue technology and coding as a hobby.</p>

            <p>Then I found the Eleven Fifty Academy. Immediately I knew this was the school and program for me. It would take some time to get everything set up to swtich careers, but it was the goal.</p>
            
            <p>I attened an Intro to Coding weekend class in mid February of this year, and signed up for the March JavaScript program days later. Within three weeks I had given up my store, got a new computer, and completely shifted gears back into the student mindset. Since then it's been a ride. Every week we are learning something new, wether it be a language, or a framework, and we're getting a whole new host of problems and errors to spin on. I've gone from fumbling with HTML and CSS to creating full stack React and Angular fronted applications, and building multiple servers and databases. There has been a tremendous amount of growth by all the members of my cohorts, and I cannot wait to see where we all go!
